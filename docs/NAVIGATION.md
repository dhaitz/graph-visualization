# Navigation Instructions
See [here](https://github.com/anvaka/pm/tree/master/about).

The `ml` parameter in the URL controls the maximum length for a link to be displayed. 
A larger value makes longer links visible, but might also obscure view and slow down your machine.

`s` is a scaling parameter.
A larger parameter makes the nodes appear smaller and further away.

After changes, load URL in new browser tab.
