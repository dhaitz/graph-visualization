# Navigation Instructions
See [here](https://github.com/anvaka/pm/tree/master/about) for the original view options.

## Viewing option configuration via URL
The `ml` parameter in the URL controls the maximum length for a link to be displayed. 
A larger value makes longer links visible, but might also obscure view and slow down your machine.

`s` is a scaling parameter.
A larger parameter makes the nodes appear smaller and further away.

After parameters are changed in the URL, a reload will usually have no effect.
Instead, you have to copy the URL and re-open it in a new browser window / tab.
