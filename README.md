# Graph Galaxies

Online visualizations can be viewed [here](https://dhaitz.github.io/graph-visualization/).

Everything based on the work of [Andrei Kashcha](https://github.com/anvaka).
See [here](http://anvaka.github.io/pm/#/)
for some awesome graph visualizations of software package dependencies.


## Navigation and display instruction
See [here](https://github.com/anvaka/pm/tree/master/about).

The `ml` parameter in the URL controls the maximum length for a link to be displayed. 
A larger value makes longer links visible, but might also obscure view and slow down your machine.
After changes, load URL in new browser tab.


## Create your own graph visualization

See [setup instructions](https://github.com/dhaitz/graph-visualization/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md).
